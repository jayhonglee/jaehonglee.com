        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Jaehong Lee, but you can call me Jay.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad at Simon Fraser University, deeply passionate about software
            engineering with a focus on practicality and real-world impact.

            My interest lies in leveraging software engineering to build products with a strategic business advantage.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've interned as a frontend software engineer at Intersystem Controls, Inc., gaining hands-on experience in
            crafting user-friendly interfaces and functional designs. Check out more on my resume below.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time,  I hit the basketball court for some hoops, and I also squeeze in some workouts when I can.
